- Realistic 3D rendering of the solar system
- All 8 planets with relative sizes and distances
- Adjustable orbital speeds for each planet
- Interactive camera controls (zoom, pan, rotate)
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Planet labels on hover
- Starry background
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Installation

No installation required. Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
